# Interactive-Pokedex-Scripting
A very quick Python script to practice web scraping. 

The whole point of this python script is to allow the user to enter the name of any Pokemon and be presented with various tidbits of information for said Pokemon.

Currently it is pretty bare bones, but it is able to get majority of the useful information that one may need. I will be continuing to add more and more as time goes on, might 
even make it user-friendly with the help of Tkinter, but that's something for future me. 

For the time being, I'm going to continue adding on features to this project, and I guess we shall see how far this goes.
